File Contents are as follows:

-COMPUTATIONAL DATA-

N-heterohexacene structures ("bluntTipXYZ" for blunt tip, "sharpTipCONTCAR" for sharp tip) both are openable in VESTA. 
Also including VASP ("INCAR" relaxation, "KPOINTS" AIMD) and NanoDCAL ("scf.input" and "trans.input") transport inputs.

-EXPERIMANTAL DATA-

Each .mat file contains a single matlab cell array with each cell containing Nx2 array with the first column corresponding 
to interelectrode distance in units of nanometers and the second column corresponding to conductance in units of G_0. Each .mat file is from a different sample (e.g. 143_5).
